## Exceptions

* [Exception notes]({% link _notebooks/exceptions.md %})
* Use exceptions to represent exceptional cases.
* *Raising an exception* is an alternative to *returning a value*.
* Use exceptions when there's no value it makes sense to return.
* A returned value must be handled by the caller.
* An may can be handled by the caller, the caller's caller, etc. It is passed through functions in the call chain between the code that raises the exception and the code that handles it.
* Catch a *specific exception*. Catching *all* exceptions hides errors from the developer.

## Assertions

* [Assertion notes]({% link _notebooks/assertions.md %})
* Use the assert statement to debug.
* An assertion error gets raised when a bug is encountered.
* Not used to catch runtime errors.
* It is not like print('statement') so be careful to omit '()'.
