## Reading  Journal Debrief

Now that we've read about Dictionaries and Tuples, we've seen almost all built-in Python types. As an activity, let's compare and contrast the types and their uses.

With the person sitting next to you, review your solutions to the `most_frequent` exercise. Pay particular attention to your strategies for iteration and sorting.

"Recursive" problem analysis from [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys), introduction and Examples and [An Introduction to 5-why](http://www.bulsuk.com/2009/03/5-why-finding-root-causes.html): What is the value in continuing to ask "why"? How do you know when you've reached a root cause?




## Recursion Practice

### Levenshtein Distance

Let's circle back on some of the recursion practice problems from last time.  We'll start by implementing Levenshtein distance together as a class.  Here is the description of the problem from last time.


Write a function called `levenshtein_distance` that takes as input two strings
and returns the [Levenshtein
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between the two
strings. Intuitively, the Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of edit
operations to transform one string into the other (for this reason Levenshtein
distance is sometimes called "edit distance"). These edits can either be
insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Note that Levenshtein distance is
similar to [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance),
but works for strings of differing lengths

Here are some examples of these operations:

1. <tt><b><u>k</u></b>itten</tt> → <tt><b><u>s</u></b>itten</tt> (substitution of `s` for `k`)
2. <tt>sitt<b><u>e</u></b>n</tt> → <tt>sitt<b><u>i</u></b>n</tt> (substitution of `i` for `e`)
3. <tt>sittin</tt> → <tt>sittin<b><u>g</u></b></tt>  (insertion of `g` at the end).

While this function seems initially daunting, it admits a very compact recursive solution. You can either work on your own to see the recursive solution, or use the recursive solution given in the Wikipedia article.


To get a better handle on this, let's consider some more examples.

`levenshtein_distance('kitten', 'smitten')` -> 2 (see below for steps)

1. kitten → sitten (k gets replaced by s)
2. sitten → smitten (insert between s and i)

`levenshtein_distance('beta', 'pedal')` -> 3 (see below for steps)

1. beta → peta (b gets replaced by p)
2. peta → petal (l gets inserted at the end)
3. petal → pedal (t gets replaced by d)

`levenshtein_distance('battle', 'bet')` -> 4 (see below for steps)

1. battle → bettle (a gets replaced by e)
2. bettle → bettl (the last e gets deleted)
3. bettl → bett (delete l)
4. bett → bet (delete t)

**Base Cases**

Let's consider the base cases when one of the two strings is empty.  What should the Levenshtein distance be in this case?

**Recursive Step**

Let's consider the different ways in which we can make the first character of string a equal to the first character of string b.  Here are the possible cases.
 - The first two characters are already equal
 - Replace the first character of string a with the first character of string b
 - Insert the first character of string b before the characters of string a
 - Delete the first character of string a

For each of these steps we have to consider two things:
 - How much does this first step cost?
 - How much does it cost to make the rest of the two strings equal to each other

Let's write a recursive implementation of this function.


## Memoization

Last class, a lot of you had the chance to do this exercise:

Write a function called `choose` that takes two integer, n and k, and returns
the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n (this is also known as
the number of [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) of k
items from a pool of n). Your solution should be implemented recursively using
[Pascal's rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule)


Here is a sample solution:

```python
def nchoosek(n, k):
    """ returns the number of combinations of size k
        that can be made from n items.

        >>> nchoosek(5,3)
        10
        >>> nchoosek(1,1)
        1
        >>> nchoosek(4,2)
        6
    """
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    if n == k:
        return 1
    return nchoosek(n - 1, k - 1) + nchoosek(n - 1, k)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
```

It passes all the unit tests!!! Hooray!

Unfortunately, this code is going to be quite slow.  To get a sense of it, let's draw a tree that shows the recursive pattern of the function.

You can even visualize the call graph within Jupyter notebook using an extension. In Linux:

```
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
$ pip install callgraph
```

Then within your notebook, you can draw a call graph as a function is called:

```
%load_ext callgraph
%callgraph nchoosek(4, 2)
```

![]({% link images/notes/day8/callgraph.png %})

As you can see, the function is recursively called multiple times with the same arguments.

In order to improve the speed of this code, we can make use of a pattern called *memoization*.  The basic idea is to transform a recursive implementation of a function to make use of a cache (in this case a Python dictionary) that remembers all previously computed values for the function.  Here's is a skeleton of a memoized recursive function (we are being a little fast and loose with the mixing pseudo code and Python, but this should become clearer as you do a concrete example.

```python
def recursive_function(input1, input2):
    if input1, input2 is a base case:
        return base case result
    if input1, input2 is in the list of already computed answers
       return precomputed answer
    return recursive step on a smaller version of input1, input2
```

Add memoization to your implementation of `nchoosek` (and/or `levenshtein_distance`) and study its impact on performance.
Think Python [Chapter 11.6](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2012.html#sec135) will also be helpful.



## Turtle World

We're devoting a bit more time to Turtle World today - with the remainder of the time, choose at least one of the fractal drawings below to pursue.


### Teleportation, Cloning, and Other Unethical Experiments on Turtles

In addition to the what you did on your day 5 reading journal and in the day 6 class activity, a few other Turtle Tricks that may prove useful.

A Turtle is a Python object, which we will learn more about next week. Turtles
have methods, which we can call to inspect change their behavior. One trick that will be useful here, which you saw in `shapes.py` but may not have thought about much, is the `speed()` function.  The `speed()` function can be used to speed up slowpoke Turtles.  While it seems weird that a speedy turtle would have a speed of 0, in this case the input `0` is reserved for having the turtle go as fast as possible (remember, when in doubt, check [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed)).

```python
import turtle
speedy = turtle.Turtle()
speedy.speed(0)
```

Other important Turtle methods include `xcor()` and `ycor()` position, and
`heading()`.

Read more about turtles [here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/turtle.html).

Since Turtles are simple creatures, mainly defined by their current position
and heading, we can "clone" them by reading these values and using them to
direct a new Turtle.

```python
leo = turtle.Turtle()
# leo does some arbitrary drawing (e.g., makes a 45 degree angle)
leo.fd(100)
leo.lt(45)
leo.fd(100)

# Create a new Turtle with the same attributes as the first
don = turtle.Turtle()
don.penup()
don.setx(leo.xcor())
don.sety(leo.ycor())
don.setheading(leo.heading())
if leo.isdown():
    don.pendown()
# don.bandana_color = "purple" # TODO: Ninja functionality not yet implemented
```

As an exercise, encapsulate this functionality in a `clone` function that
takes a Turtle argument and returns a *new* Turtle with the same position
and heading, leaving the original Turtle untouched.

## Fractals

[Fractals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) are geometrical constructions
that display self-similar repeated patterns at every scale as you zoom in.
They are often extremely beautiful, and are [found throughout
nature](http://www.wired.com/2010/09/fractal-patterns-in-nature/). Fractals
are also useful across many fields, from antenna engineering to poetry to
finance. Check out [Yale's Panorama of Fractals and their
Uses](http://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/Panorama/Welcome.html) for more
examples.

Today, we will teach our turtles to draw fractal shapes using recursion. A
very cool recursive drawing we can create is called the snowflake curve (or
[Koch snowflake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)). To get
started, let's write a function called `snow_flake_side` with the following
signature:

```python
def snow_flake_side(turtle, length, level):
    """Draw a side of the snowflake curve with side length length and recursion
    depth of level"""
```

The `snow_flake_side` function should have a base case that draws the following image:

![]({% link images/notes/day7/snow_flake_1.png %})

The recursive step should replace each of the line segments above with a
`snow_flake_side` with size `length / 3.0` and recursion depth `level - 1`. Take
some time to work on this and then we'll discuss as a group.

Once you have completed your `snow_flake_side` function, create a function
called `snow_flake` that draws the whole snowflake.

### Recursive Trees

Next, we will draw a tree using recursion. Define a function called
`recursive_tree` that takes as input a turtle, a branch length, and a
recursion depth and draws the recursive tree to the canvas.

```python
def recursive_tree(turtle, branch_length, level):
    """Draw a tree with branch length branch_length and recursion depth of level
    """
```

The base case is:

![]({% link images/notes/day7/tree_1.png %})

This structure is given by moving forward `branch_length` steps (assuming the
turtle has the correct orientation).

For the recursive step, you should:

1. Draw the line as above
2. Clone your turtle
3. Turn the new turtle left 30 degrees
4. Recurse using the cloned turtle to draw a tree with branch length `branch_length * 0.6` and depth `level - 1
5. Hide the cloned turtle using the `hideturtle` method
6. Back the original turtle up `branch_length / 3.0`
7. Clone your turtle
8. Turn the new turtle right 40 degrees
9. Recurse using the cloned turtle to draw a tree with branch length `branch_length * 0.64` and depth `level - 1`
10. Hide the cloned turtle using the `hideturtle` method

After implementing the recursive step, if you set `level` to 1 more than the
base case (which will either be 1 or 2 depending on what level you consider
the base case), you will get the following picture:

![]({% link images/notes/day7/tree_2.png %})

Once you've built your `recursive_tree` function, try making a few
enhancements:

* Make the base case change the pen color for the turtle to green (this will simulate the appearance of leaves if you do a high enough depth)
* Add some randomness to the degree of left turn, right turn, and scaling so that you get more naturalistic looking trees
* Add more than two branches

## More Recursion

The Koch snowflake and our recursive tree are both part of a more general
class of curves called L-systems ([Lindenmayer
Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)). Next, read the linked
Wikipedia article on L-systems and try to implement Sierpinski's triangle and
fractal plant.

_Hint 1_: For Sierpinski's triangle you will want to create a function to
generate both symbols A and B and have them call each other.

_Hint 2_: For the fractal plant you should create the following functions to
save and then restore then Turtle's state (symbols `[` and `]` respectively):

```python
def save_turtle_state(turtle_states, t):
    turtle_states.append((t.xcor(), t.ycor(), t.heading()))

def restore_turtle_state(turtle_states, t):
    s = turtle_states.pop()
    t.penup()
    t.setx(s[0])
    t.sety(s[1])
    t.setheading(s[2])
    t.pendown()
```
